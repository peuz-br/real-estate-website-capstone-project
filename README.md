## EstateExplorer - The answer to your estate problems!

Hello, and welcome to my capstone project. In this project, I will be showcasing all the skills and competencies I've learned over the long two years of dedication. The focus of the project is to present a complete real estate website with all the necessary functions for an excellent user experience. Here, you will have the possibility to:
- search for properties, filtering your search by location, price, size, among other filters to enhance the customer experience.

- other vital functionalities such as user authentication, property management (for sellers and buyers), and even a feature where you can find the property you're looking for on the map!

 Quite an experience, isn't it? So, let's get started!

## Looking for the BEST real estate Platform? Check it out:

- The real estate market is almost always missing a user-friendly platform where buyers, sellers, renters, and real estate agents can all connect at the same time. As a buyer, whenever you search for properties on one of the millions of real estate websites, you often run into small problems while looking for your dream homeâ€”like inadequate filters, incorrect price listings, and even houses that are no longer available. Sellers and real estate agents often struggle with managing their listed properties and communicating with potential clients. Today, we need an integrated solution that brings all of this together on one screen! And that's exactly what we're aiming to solve with this project!
