# real-estate-website-capstone-project
Hello, and welcome to my capstone project. In this project, I will be showcasing all the skills and competencies I've learned over the long two years of dedication. The focus of the project is to present a complete real estate website with all the necessary functions for an excellent user experience. Here, you will have the possibility to:
- search for properties, filtering your search by location, price, size, among other filters to enhance the customer experience.

- other vital functionalities such as user authentication, property management (for sellers and buyers), and even a feature where you can find the property you're looking for on the map!

 Quite an experience, isn't it? So, let's get started!
